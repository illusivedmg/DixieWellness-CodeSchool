# Dixie Wellness & Student Health

### A Project for DSU Code School, Summer 2018

In this project we created a potential revamp to the DSU Student Health and Wellness page, as it's hard to find and compares unfavorably with the upstanding examples set by those of BYU and Weber State University. In addition to collating as much helpful and high-quality content as we could, we added the functionality of an Appointment Scheduler with the Google Calendar API, as well as Study Group Coordination with a MongoDB database hosted at MLAB. As of Sept 2018, any project in VueJS is unfortunately incompatible with the rest of the DSU website, and there are no plans for its implementation.

As the only non-freshman on the team, I was ultimately responsible for all of the more advanced JavaScript in the server, Google API, and database implementation; as well as in the Appointment form (client/content/Form/), and Study Group coordinator (client/content/StudyGroup/), leaving the front-end Vue/Vuetify implementation, content/resource selection, and styling to the rest of the team.

Created with the following:
* VueJS
* Vuetify
* NodeJS
* Moment.js
* Express
* Mongoose
* Morgan
* Nodemon
* MongoDB
* Google Calendar API
* Donuts
